### Enhanced Transcription Flow

The system now uses a dual-layer approach for speech recognition:

1. **Primary**: Twilio's built-in speech recognition for real-time processing
2. **Fallback**: OpenAI Whisper for higher accuracy when Twilio recognition fails
3. **Multi-language**: Supports English and regional languages like Malayalam

### Call Flow Architecture

```
Caller speaks ‚Üí Twilio receives audio
    ‚Üì
Twilio Speech Recognition (Primary)
    ‚Üì
If recognition fails ‚Üí Record audio ‚Üí Whisper Transcription (Fallback)
    ‚Üì
Voice Agent Processing ‚Üí Database Operations
    ‚Üì
ElevenLabs TTS ‚Üí Response to caller
```

### ElevenLabs Configuration

1. Sign up at [elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io)
2. Create or select a voice model (recommended: professional, clear voice)
3. Get your API key from the profile section
4. Copy the Voice ID from your selected voice
5. Add both to your `.env` file

### OpenAI Whisper Configuration

1. Create an OpenAI account at [openai.com](https://openai.com)
2. Generate an API key from the API section
3. Add the key to your environment variables
4. The system will automatically use Whisper for transcription fallback
