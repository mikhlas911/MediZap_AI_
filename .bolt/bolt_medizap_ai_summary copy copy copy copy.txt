Our conversation has focused on debugging and improving the MediZap AI system.

Initially, we discussed a browser error related to the ElevenLabs conversational AI widget, specifically a missing ClinicName dynamic variable. This issue was addressed with an implementation plan.

Subsequently, the conversation shifted to a more complex problem: the AI voice agent's inability to fetch doctors and their availability, despite successfully accessing department information. I've provided a detailed explanation of why this occurs, highlighting the multi-step parsing and data retrieval challenges involved in identifying specific doctors, dates, and time slots, which are more intricate than simply fetching department names.
