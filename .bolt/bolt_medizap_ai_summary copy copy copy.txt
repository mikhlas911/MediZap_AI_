Here's a summary of our discussions and the progress made on the MediZap AI project:

The MediZap AI project is a comprehensive clinic management web application. Our recent focus has been on developing new features, particularly an AI voice agent for patient registration and appointment booking, accessible via QR codes in clinics.

Here's an overview of the key areas we've addressed:

Core System Functionality:

The system includes robust clinic management features, allowing for the management of departments, doctors, and their schedules.
It supports real-time appointment booking and provides analytics for call center operations.
A significant addition is the QR-based walk-in registration system, enabling patients to register on-site via mobile-friendly forms.
New Feature Development - Signup and User Management:

We've implemented a self-service signup option within the login module, catering to both new clinic administrators and patients/guests.
For first-time guest bookings, the system now automatically registers a new patient ID in the database, ensuring a seamless flow.
The system distinguishes between different user types (clinic admin, registered patient, guest) and adjusts the user experience accordingly.
AI Voice Agent Frontend Visual:

A modern, Siri-inspired AI agent visual has been created. This includes animated circles, pulsing effects, and dynamic lines that react to voice input and output, providing clear visual feedback.
The design maintains consistency with the overall MediZap AI dashboard's aesthetic, color scheme, and fonts.
AI Voice Agent Integration:

The AI voice agent is integrated to handle patient registration (collecting details via voice) and appointment booking (selecting doctor, date, and time).
It supports multi-language interaction, currently with English and Hindi using ElevenLabs for speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS). The architecture is modular to allow for future integration of Malayalam using Whisper ASR and Google TTS.
The agent intelligently adapts its flow based on whether the user is a registered patient or a guest.
The voice agent is accessible via a QR code, leading to a mobile-friendly interface.
Specific Fixes and Improvements:

Clinic Admin Registration Flow: We've improved the clinic registration process for new clinic administrators. Instead of showing a "no clinic registered" error, the clinic registration form is now presented immediately after a new clinic admin signs up.
Patient Signup Redirection: The issue where newly registered patients were shown a generic welcome message has been resolved. Patients are now seamlessly redirected to the public booking page, which integrates the AI voice agent, allowing them to immediately proceed with booking appointments.
The project aims to provide a comprehensive, AI-powered solution for clinic management, enhancing both staff efficiency and patient experience through intuitive interfaces and advanced voice capabilities.
