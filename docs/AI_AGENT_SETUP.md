# AI Agent Setup Guide for MediZap AI

This guide explains how to configure your ElevenLabs Conversational AI agent to securely access MediZap AI's Supabase Edge Functions.

## Overview

The MediZap AI system uses custom secret authentication to allow your AI agent to securely access the database through Edge Functions. This approach is simple, efficient, and secure.

## Step 1: Set the Secret in Supabase

First, you need to set the `ELEVENLABS_FUNCTION_SECRET` environment variable in your Supabase project.

### Using Supabase CLI:

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI if you haven't already
npm install -g supabase

# Login to Supabase
supabase login

# Link to your project (replace with your project reference)
supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref

# Set the secret (replace with a strong, unique secret)
supabase secrets set ELEVENLABS_FUNCTION_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-here
```

### Using Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Edge Functions
3. In the Environment Variables section, add:
   - **Name**: `ELEVENLABS_FUNCTION_SECRET`
   - **Value**: `your-super-secret-key-here` (use a strong, unique secret)
4. Click "Add variable"

## Step 2: Configure ElevenLabs Custom Tools

In your ElevenLabs Conversational AI agent, you need to configure custom tools to call the MediZap AI Edge Functions with the secret header.

### Tool 1: Get Departments

curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/get-departments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Elevenlabs-Secret: your-super-secret-key-here" \
  -d '{"clinicId": "your-clinic-id"}'

# Test get-doctors
curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/get-doctors \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Elevenlabs-Secret: your-super-secret-key-here" \
  -d '{"clinicId": "your-clinic-id", "includeAvailability": true}'
```

### Expected Response Format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [...],
  "meta": {
    "total": 5,
    "count": 5,
    "limit": null,
    "offset": 0,
    "hasMore": false
  },
  "filters": {
    "clinicId": "your-clinic-id",
    "isActive": true
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Step 4: AI Agent Conversation Flow

Here's a recommended conversation flow for your AI agent:

1. **Greeting**: Welcome the patient and ask how you can help
2. **Intent Detection**: Determine if they want to book an appointment or register as walk-in
3. **Patient Information**: Collect name and phone number
4. **Department Selection**: Use `get-departments` to show available departments
5. **Doctor Selection**: Use `get-doctors` to show available doctors in the selected department
6. **Date/Time Selection**: Show available slots from doctor's availability
7. **Confirmation**: Review all details with the patient
8. **Booking**: Use `book-appointment` to create the appointment
9. **Confirmation**: Provide appointment details and ID

## Security Best Practices

1. **Keep the Secret Secure**: Never expose the `ELEVENLABS_FUNCTION_SECRET` in client-side code
2. **Use Strong Secrets**: Generate a long, random secret key (at least 32 characters)
3. **Rotate Secrets**: Periodically update the secret for enhanced security
4. **Monitor Logs**: Check Edge Function logs for any unauthorized access attempts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **401 Unauthorized**: Check that the `X-Elevenlabs-Secret` header is included and matches the configured secret
2. **500 Internal Server Error**: Verify that Supabase environment variables are set correctly
3. **Empty Response**: Ensure the clinic ID exists and has active departments/doctors

### Debug Mode:

The Edge Functions include extensive logging. Check the Supabase Edge Functions logs for detailed debug information about each request.
